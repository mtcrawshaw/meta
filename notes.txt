Todo:
Add PPO for single task
- Just get PPO running on CPU
    - Beat CartPole-v1
    - Make sure PolicyNetwork.logstd is changing
    - Write tests
- Clean up
    - Build up rollouts as numpy arrays
    - Make tensor shapes consistent
    - Move to settings file
    - Convert to package
    - black/pylint/mypy
- Add GPU support
- Add multiprocessing
- Add support for recurrent policies?
Add MAML for single task distribution
Add modular meta learning for meta learning
Other baselines for meta learning?
Implement new ideas for meta learning
Implement ML^3 for multi task learning
Implement learned loss convexity regularization for multi task learning

Training settings to add/consider:
- Network architecture hyperparameters
- Choice of optimizer and optimizer hyperparameters
- Parameter sharing between actor and critic
- Collecting data from multiple episodes into a single (larger) minibatch

Leads for PPO bugs:
- Manual tests (Loss values first, then new parameters)
- Play with sign of action_loss, setting value and entropy to 0, and setting
  action_loss to regular VPG loss. Why does action_loss seem to be backward?
