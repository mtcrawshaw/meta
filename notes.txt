Todo:
Add PPO for single task
- Just get PPO running on CPU
    - Beat CartPole-v1
    - Make sure PolicyNetwork.logstd is changing
    - Write tests
      - Loss values/intermediate calculations
      - Tensor sizes
- Clean up
    - Build up rollouts as numpy arrays
    - Make tensor shapes consistent
    - Move to settings file
    - Convert to package
    - black/pylint/mypy
- Add GPU support
- Add multiprocessing
- Add support for recurrent policies?
Add MAML for single task distribution
Add modular meta learning for meta learning
Other baselines for meta learning?
Implement new ideas for meta learning
Implement ML^3 for multi task learning
Implement learned loss convexity regularization for multi task learning

Training settings to add/consider:
- Network architecture hyperparameters
- Choice of optimizer and optimizer hyperparameters
- Parameter sharing between actor and critic
- Collecting data from multiple episodes into a single (larger) minibatch

Leads for PPO bugs:
- Why does action_loss seem to be backward? The value is small when the policy is
  randomly initialized, then the policy will converge to around 9.5 average reward
  (which means the agent is dying as quickly as possible) and then the value of
  action_loss peaks and plateaus. Why does it increase there?
- Tensor shapes weren't consistent before, caused some weird errors with broadcasting
  results when shapes didn't match up. Inspect rollout information again and make sure
  everything is still good, especially log probs calculations.
- It seems to work when value_loss_coeff = 0.0. This is especially weird because the
  parameters of the actor are not at all involved in the computation of value_loss. If
  you set action_loss to just value_loss and then look at the values of param.grad for
  name, param in self.policy_network.named_parameters(), the gradients of the actor
  parameters are None. (Note: After combining rollout info from multiple episodes into
  one batch, training no longer works even when value_loss_coeff = 0.0)
- At this point, I think we just need to test everything. What we need to test:
  - Rollout values after combining
  - Values of returns, advantages, and losses
  - Tensor sizes
