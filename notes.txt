Road map:
--> PPO for single task
    Add MetaWorld support
    Splitting networks for MTL
    PCGrad, sparse sharing, soft-layer ordering, other baselines for MTL
    Splitting networks for meta learning
    MAML and other baselines for meta learning
    Hyperparameter optimization
    Tests of statistical significance
    Learned loss convexity regularization for MTL

Current sprint:
    Convert List[RolloutStorage] back to RolloutStorage
    Set new continuous environment benchmark
    Move to settings file
    Move run_discrete and run_continuous into tests
    Make policy return distribution object, not arguments
    Add multiprocessing
    Add GPU support
--> Add support for recurrent policies
    Test for Box((n1, n2))
    Fix comments, typing, and naming (episodes vs. rollouts), suppress warnings

Before merging to master:
- Use black, pylint, and mypy to clean up
- Make sure "pytest meta/" passes

Future additions:
- PPO training settings to add/consider:
    - Network architecture hyperparameters
    - Choice of optimizer and optimizer hyperparameters
    - Parameter sharing between actor and critic
    - Deterministic acting (i.e. always choose action with highest prob)
- Optimize data transfer to GPU

Tomorrow:
I had to add a +1 to the index used to access an element of rollout.dones in the
computation of returns and advantages in order to get our numbers to line up with the
ikostrikov numbers. This is strange though, because they lined up before the changes to
accommodate a recurrent policy. Now the update values tests don't pass, but they do pass
if I make that +1 change to the index to done. What is going on here? The test_train
cases also fail now.
