Goal: Minimize diff with develop branch while keeping performance

Tasks to convert ikostrikov code into our format:
    - Metric formatting/output in train.py
    - Argument names/formatting in main.py
    - Method definitions in utils.py
    - Typing, comments, and docstrings
    - Minimize diff for all files in meta/


Differences to keep/toggle to search for bugs:
- Computation of action, action_log_probs in PPOPolicy act() and evaluate_actions()
- Delta computation in PPOPolicy update()
- Observation normalization + other wrapped functionality
