Goal: Minimize diff with develop branch while keeping performance

Tasks to convert ikostrikov code into our format:
    - Make training run on unwrapped environment
    - Make train.py run single process training
    - Restructure training loop to match develop/num-env-steps argument
    - Align function signatures for all files in meta/
    - Minimize diff for all files in meta/

Conversion tasks to leave for later:
    - Remove proper time limits option
    - Remove masks
    - Remove random seed
