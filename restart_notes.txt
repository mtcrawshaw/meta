Goal: Minimize diff with develop branch while keeping performance

Tasks to convert ikostrikov code into our format:
    - Catch continuous environments up with discrete ones
        - Create new branch, start from 1300188
        - Benchmark original metrics
        - Move from 1300188 to base_restart, preserving performance on continuous
          environments
    - Implement collect_rollout() in meta/train.py
    - Restructure training loop to match develop/num-env-steps argument
    - Minimize diff for all files in meta/

Conversion tasks to leave for later:
    - Unwrap enviroment
    - Remove masks
    - Remove proper time limits option
