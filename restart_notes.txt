Goal: Minimize diff with develop branch while keeping performance

Tasks to convert ikostrikov code into our format:
    - Method definitions in utils.py
    - Typing, comments, and docstrings
    - Minimize diff for all files in meta/


Differences in implementations:
- Delta computation
- Observation + reward normalization
- Last actor layer initialization
- Not resetting obs before adding to rollouts in develop:meta/train.py
